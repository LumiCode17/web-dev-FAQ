        <p>My Name is Olumide Jones and i'm a front-end developer with a fullstack background, i learnt Web-development in <abbr title="Digital Career Institute GmbH">DCI</abbr>, my skills are <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>, <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>, <abbr title="React.JS">React</abbr>  and i'm currently learning <abbr title="Wordpress">Wordpress</abbr>, <abbr title="Wix">Wix</abbr>, <abbr title="Tailwind CSS">Tailwind </abbr>; also currently looking for job or internship..

            <br>The purpose of this project is to help Web-developers to conquer everyday questions being asked especially junior developers like myself who are in the process of winning an interview, i've listed many questions and answers are provided. <br>As a Junior Web Developer and a job searcher, putting together the little experience i've garthered from both employers, interviewers, senior developers and junior developers like me i saw that it's not just the language that you know or how you write your codes that actually set you ahead but also the objectives. I've seeing some junior developers that can match a senior developer of many years when it comes to writing codes, they're very skillful BUT alot of them are only good when it comes to coding but can't explain some questions or give answers to some questions about the languages they know, though they can use it but they don't know or they find it difficult in giving answer to questions about coding.
            So because of this i created this little web and in it you've several questions and answers to those languages, framework tools and about web-Dev in general that are useful for everyday life and especially for interviews.
            
            Be free to add to them if you would.
            
            Thanks
