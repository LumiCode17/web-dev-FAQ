      <div class="quest">What is Angular?</div>
      <div id="ans" class="ans" style="display: none;">Angular is a TypeScript-based front-end web application framework. It targets both the browser and the server. Angular is one of the most popular frameworks for UI design today, with hundreds of thousands of developers worldwide contributing to its community project.</div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest">How does an Angular application work?</div>
      <div id="ansTwo" class="ans" style="display: none;">Every Angular app consists of a file named angular.json. This file will contain all the configurations of the app. While building the app, the builder looks at this file to find the entry point of the application. Following is an image of the angular.json file:

      <div class="quest">What are some of the advantages of Angular over other frameworks?</div>
      <div id="ansThree" class="ans" style="display: none;">Features that are provided out of the box - Angular provides a number of built-in features like routing, state management, rxjs library and http servicesstraight out of the box. This means that one does not need to look for the above-stated features separately. They are all provided with angular.<br>
        Declarative UI - Angular uses HTML to render the UI of an application. HTML is a declarative language and is much easier to use than JavaScript.<br>
        Long-term Google support - Google announced Long-term support for Angular. This means that Google plans to stick with Angular and further scale up its ecosystem.</div>

      <div class="quest">What are the advantages of Angular over React?</div>
      <div id="ansFour" class="ans" style="display: none;"><b>ANGULAR:</b> Angular supports bidirectional data binding as well as mutable data.<br>The biggest benefit of Angular is that it enables dependency injection.<br>Angular can be used in both mobile and web development.<br>Angular features a wide wide range of tools, libraries, frameworks, plugins, and so on that make development faster and more fun.<br>Angular uses Typescript.<br><b>REACT:</b>
        React only supports unidirectional and immutable data binding.<br>React allows us to either accomplish it ourselves or with the aid of a third-party library.<br>React can only be used in UI development only.<br>In React we can use third-party libraries for any features.<br>React uses Javascript. </div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest">List out differences between AngularJS and Angular?</div>
      <div id="ansFive" class="ans" style="display: none;">...Architecture
        AngularJS uses MVC or Model-View-Controller architecture, where the Model contains the business logic, the Controller processes information and the View shows the information present in the Model.
        Angular replaces controllers with Components. Components are nothing but directives with a predefined template.<br>
       ...Language
        AngularJS uses JavaScript language, which is a dynamically typed language.
        Angular uses TypeScript language, which is a statically typed language and is a superset of JavaScript. By using statically typed language, Angular provides better performance while developing larger applications.<br>
        ...Mobile Support
        AngularJS does not provide mobile support.
        Angular is supported by all popular mobile browsers.<br>
        ...Structure
        While developing larger applications, the process of maintaining code becomes tedious in the case of AngularJS.
        In the case of Angular, it is easier to maintain code for larger applications as it provides a better structure.<br>
        ...Expression Syntax
        While developing an AngularJS application, a developer needs to remember the correct ng-directive for binding an event or a property. Whereas in Angular, property binding is done using "[ ]" attribute and event binding is done using "( )" attribute.</div>

      <div class="quest">How are Angular expressions different from JavaScript expressions?
      </div>
      <div id="ansSix" class="ans" style="display: none;">The first and perhaps, the biggest difference is that Angular expressions allow us to write JavaScript in HTML which is not the case when it comes to JavaScript expressions.<br>
        Next, Angular expressions are evaluated against a local scope object whereas JavaScript expressions are against a global window object. Let's understand that better with an example : </div>

      <div class="quest">What are Single Page Applications (SPA)?
      </div>
      <div id="ansSeven" class="ans" style="display: none;">Single page applications are web based applications that only need to be loaded once, with new functionality consisting of only minor changes to the user interface. It does not load new HTML pages to display the content of the new page, but rather generates it dynamically. This is made feasible by JavaScript's ability to alter DOM components on the current page. A Single Page Application method is speedier, resulting in a more consistent user experience. </div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest">What are templates in Angular?
      </div>
      <div id="ansEight" class="ans" style="display: none;">A template is a kind of HTML that instructs Angular about how to display a component. An Angular HTML template, like conventional HTML, produces a view, or user interface, in the browser, but with far more capabilities. Angular API evaluates an HTML template of a component, creates HTML, and renders it.

        There are two ways to create a template in an Angular component:
        
        Inline Template
        Linked Template
        Inline Template: The component decorator's template config is used to specify an inline HTML template for a component. The Template will be wrapped inside the single or double quotes.</div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest"> What are directives in Angular?
      </div>
      <div id="ansNine" class="ans" style="display: none;">A directive is a class in Angular that is declared with a @Directive decorator.

        Every directive has its own behaviour and can be imported into various components of an application.
      <br>When to use a directive?

      Consider an application, where multiple components need to have similar functionalities. The norm thing to do is by adding this functionality individually to every component but, this task is tedious to perform. In such a situation, one can create a directive having the required functionality and then, import the directive to components which require this functionality.<br>
      
      Types of directives:
      
      1. Component directives
      
      These form the main class in directives. Instead of @Directive decorator we use @Component decorator to declare these directives. These directives have a view, a stylesheet and a selector property.<br>
      
      2. Structural directives
      
      These directives are generally used to manipulate DOM elements.
      Every structural directive has a ‘ * ’ sign before them.
      We can apply these directives to any DOM element.<br>
      Attribute Directives

      These directives are used to change the look and behaviour of a DOM element. Let’s understand attribute directives by creating one:</div>

      <div class="quest">Explain Components, Modules and Services in Angular
      </div>
      <div id="ansTen" class="ans" style="display: none;">For better understanding, I would like you to create an Angular application by running the following inside the command terminal: ng new angularApp

        The above command will create an angular application in the directory.
        
        Next, let's move on to understand Components, Modules, and Services.
        
        Components
        In Angular, components are the basic building blocks, which control a part of the UI for any application.
        
        A component is defined using the @Component decorator. Every component consists of three parts, the template which loads the view for the component, a stylesheet which defines the look and feel for the component, and a class that contains the business logic for the component.
        
        For creating a component, inside the command terminal, navigate to the directory of the application created, and run the following command: ng generate component testOr ng g c test
        
        One can see the generated component inside src/app/test folder. The component will be defined inside test.component.ts

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest">What is the scope?

      </div>
      <div id="ansEleven" class="ans" style="display: none;">In Angular, a scope is an object that refers to the application model. It is a context in which expressions can be executed. These scopes are grouped hierarchically, comparable to the DOM structure of the application. A scope aids in the propagation of various events and the monitoring of expressions.</div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest">What is data binding in Angular?
      </div>
      <div id="ansTwelve" class="ans" style="display: none;">Data binding is one of the most significant and effective elements for creating communication between the DOM and the component. It makes designing interactive apps easier by reducing the need to worry about data pushing and pulling between the component and the template.<br>

        There are Four types of Data binding in Angular: 
        
        Property Binding
        Event Binding
        String Interpolation
        Two way data binding
        Property Binding: One method of data binding is called property binding. In property binding, we connect a DOM element's property to a field that is a declared property in our TypeScript component code. In reality, Angular transforms string interpolation into property binding internally.
        
        Event Binding: Using event binding, you may respond to DOM events like button clicks and mouse movements. When a DOM event (such as a click, change, or keyup) occurs, the component's designated method is called.
        
        String Interpolation: In order to export data from TypeScript code to an HTML template( view ), String Interpolation is a one way data binding approach. The data from the component is shown to the view using the template expression enclosed in double curly braces. The value of a component property is added by using string interpolation.

      <div class="quest">Does a hyperlink only apply to text?
      </div>
      <div id="ansThirteen" class="ans" style="display: none;">No, hyperlinks can be used both on texts and images. The HTML anchor tag defines a hyperlink that links one page to another page. The “href” attribute is the most important attribute of the HTML anchor tag.</div>

      <div class="quest">What is two way data binding in Angular?
      </div>
      <div id="ansFourteen" class="ans" style="display: none;">Data sharing between a component class and its template is referred to as two-way data binding. If you alter data in one area, it will immediately reflate at the other end. This happens instantly and automatically, ensuring that the HTML template and TypeScript code are always up to date. Property binding and event binding are coupled in two-way data binding.</div>

      <div class="quest">What are Decorators and their types in Angular?
      </div>
      <div id="ansFifteen" class="ans" style="display: none;">Decorators are a fundamental concept in TypeScript, and because Angular heavily relies on TypeScript, decorators have become an important element of Angular as well.

        Decorators are methods or design patterns that are labeled with a prefixed @ symbol and preceded by a class, method, or property. They enable the modification of a service, directive, or filter before it is utilized. A decorator, in essence, provides configuration metadata that specifies how a component, class, or method should be processed, constructed, and used at runtime. Angular includes a number of decorators which attach various types of metadata to classes, allowing the system to understand what all these classes signify and how they should function.</div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest">What are annotations in Angular ?
      </div>
      <div id="ansSixteen" class="ans" style="display: none;">These are language features that are hard-coded. Annotations are merely metadata that is set on a class to reflect the metadata library. When a user annotates a class, the compiler adds an annotations property to the class, saves an annotation array in it, and then attempts to instantiate an object with the same name as the annotation, providing the metadata into the constructor. Annotations in AngularJs are not predefined, therefore we can name them ourselves</div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest"> What are pure Pipes?
      </div>
      <div id="ansSeventeen" class="ans" style="display: none;">These are pipelines that only employ pure functions. As a result, a pure pipe does not employ any internal state, and the output remains constant as long as the parameters provided remain constant. Angular calls the pipe only when the parameters being provided change. A single instance of the pure pipe is utilized in all components.</div>

      <button onclick="myQuest17()" id="showBtn">Show Answer</button>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest">What are impure pipes?
      </div>
      <div id="ansEighteen" class="ans" style="display: none;">Angular calls an impure pipe for each change detection cycle, independent of the change in the input fields. For each of these pipes, several pipe instances are produced. These pipes' inputs can be altered.

        By default, all pipelines are pure. However, as demonstrated below, you can specify impure pipes using the pure property.</div>

      <div class="quest">What is Pipe transform Interface in Angular?
      </div>
      <div id="ansNineteen" class="ans" style="display: none;">An interface used by pipes to accomplish a transformation. Angular calls the transform function with the value of a binding as the first argument and any arguments as the second parameter in list form. This interface is used to implement custom pipes.</div>
