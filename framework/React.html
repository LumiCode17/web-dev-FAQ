      <div class="quest">What is React?</div>
      <div id="ans" class="ans" style="display: none;">React is a front-end JavaScript library developed by Facebook in
        2011.<br>
        It follows the component based approach which helps in building reusable UI components.<br>
        It is used for developing complex and interactive web and mobile UI.<br>
        Even though it was open-sourced only in 2015, it has one of the largest communities supporting it.</div>

      <div class="quest">Differentiate between Real DOM and Virtual DOM?</div>
      <div id="ansTwo" class="ans" style="display: none;">
        <b>Real Dom</b><br>
        1. It updates slow. <br>
        2. Can directly update HTML.
        3. Creates a new DOM if element updates.
        4. DOM manipulation is very expensive.
        5. Too much of memory wastage.
        <b>Virtual Dom</b><br>
        1. It updates faster.<br>
        2. Can’t directly update HTML.<br>
        3. Updates the JSX if element updates. <br>
        4. DOM manipulation is very easy.<br>
        5. No memory wastage.

      <div class="quest">What are the features of React? </div>
      <div id="ansThree" class="ans" style="display: none;">Major features of React are listed below:
        1. It uses the virtual DOM instead of the real DOM.<br>
        2. It uses server-side rendering.<br>
        3. It follows uni-directional data flow or data binding.</div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest"> List some of the major advantages of React.</div>
      <div id="ansFour" class="ans" style="display: none;">Some of the major advantages of React are:

        1. It increases the application’s performance<br>
        2. It can be conveniently used on the client as well as server side<br>
        3. Because of JSX, code’s readability increases<br>
        4. React is easy to integrate with other frameworks like Meteor, Angular, etc<br>
        5. Using React, writing UI test cases become extremely easy </div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest"> What are the limitations of React?</div>
      <div id="ansFive" class="ans" style="display: none;">Limitations of React are listed below:

        1. React is just a library, not a full-blown framework<br>
        2. Its library is very large and takes time to understand<br>
        3. It can be little difficult for the novice programmers to understand<br>
        4. Coding gets complex as it uses inline templating and JSX

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest">What is JSX?
      </div>
      <div id="ansSix" class="ans" style="display: none;">JSX is a shorthand for JavaScript XML. This is a type of file
        used by React which utilizes the expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax. This makes
        the HTML file really easy to understand.</div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest"> What do you understand by Virtual DOM? Explain its works.
      </div>
      <div id="ansSeven" class="ans" style="display: none;">A virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript object which
        originally is just a copy of the real DOM. It is a node tree that lists the elements, their attributes and
        content as Objects and their properties. React’s render function creates a node tree out of the React
        components. It then updates this tree in response to the mutations in the data model which is caused by various
        actions done by the user or by the system. Check out this Web developer course online to learn more about react.

      <div class="quest"> Why can’t browsers read JSX?
      </div>
      <div id="ansEight" class="ans" style="display: none;">Browsers can only read JavaScript objects but JSX in not a
        regular JavaScript object. Thus to enable a browser to read JSX, first, we need to transform JSX file into a
        JavaScript object using JSX transformers like Babel and then pass it to the browser.</div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest">What is semantic HTML?
      </div>
      <div id="ansTen" class="ans" style="display: none;">Semantic HTML is a coding style. It is the use of <b>HTML
          markup</b> to reinforce the semantics or meaning of the content. For example: In semantic HTML <b>b</b> tag is
        not used for bold statement as well as <b>i</b> tag is used for italic. Instead of these we use <b>strong</b>
        and <b>em</b> tags.

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest">In React, everything is a component.” Explain.

      </div>
      <div id="ansEleven" class="ans" style="display: none;">Components are the building blocks of a React application’s
        UI. These components split up the entire UI into small independent and reusable pieces. Then it renders each of
        these components independent of each other without affecting the rest of the UI.</div>

      <button onclick="myQuest11()" id="showBtn">Show Answer</button>
    </div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest">What is the purpose of render() in React.
      </div>
      <div id="ansTwelve" class="ans" style="display: none;">Each React component must have a render() mandatorily. It
        returns a single React element which is the representation of the native DOM component. If more than one HTML
        element needs to be rendered, then they must be grouped together inside one enclosing tag such as ..form..,
        ..group.., ..div.. etc. This function must be kept pure i.e., it must return the same result each time it is
        invoked.</div>

    </div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest">What is Props?
      </div>
      <div id="ansThirteen" class="ans" style="display: none;">Props is the shorthand for Properties in React. They are
        read-only components which must be kept pure i.e. immutable. They are always passed down from the parent to the
        child components throughout the application. A child component can never send a prop back to the parent
        component. This help in maintaining the unidirectional data flow and are generally used to render the
        dynamically generated data.</div>

    </div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest">What is a state in React and how is it used?
      </div>
      <div id="ansFourteen" class="ans" style="display: none;">States are the heart of React components. States are the
        source of data and must be kept as simple as possible. Basically, states are the objects which determine
        components rendering and behavior. They are mutable unlike the props and create dynamic and interactive
        components. They are accessed via this.state().</div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest"> What is arrow function in React? How is it used?
      </div>
      <div id="ansFifteen" class="ans" style="display: none;">Arrow functions are more of brief syntax for writing the
        function expression. They are also called ‘fat arrow‘ (=>) the functions. These functions allow to bind the
        context of the components properly since in ES6 auto binding is not available by default. Arrow functions are
        mostly useful while working with the higher order functions.</div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest"> What are the different phases of React component’s lifecycle?
      </div>
      <div id="ansSixteen" class="ans" style="display: none;">There are three different phases of React component’s
        lifecycle:

        ..Initial Rendering Phase: This is the phase when the component is about to start its life journey and make its
        way to the DOM.<br>
        ..Updating Phase: Once the component gets added to the DOM, it can potentially update and re-render only when a
        prop or state change occurs. That happens only in this phase.<br>
        ..Unmounting Phase: This is the final phase of a component’s life cycle in which the component is destroyed and
        removed from the DOM.</div>

      <button onclick="myQuest16()" id="showBtn">Show Answer</button>
    </div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest"> Explain the lifecycle methods of React components in detail.
      </div>
      <div id="ansSeventeen" class="ans" style="display: none;">Some of the most important lifecycle methods are:

        1. componentWillMount() – Executed just before rendering takes place both on the client as well as
        server-side.<br>
        2. componentDidMount() – Executed on the client side only after the first render.<br>
        3. componentWillReceiveProps() – Invoked as soon as the props are received from the parent class and before
        another render is called.<br>
        4. shouldComponentUpdate() – Returns true or false value based on certain conditions. If you want your component
        to update, return true else return false. By default, it returns false.<br>
        5. componentWillUpdate() – Called just before rendering takes place in the DOM.<br>
        6. componentDidUpdate() – Called immediately after rendering takes place.<br>
        7. componentWillUnmount() – Called after the component is unmounted from the DOM. It is used to clear up the
        memory spaces.</div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest">What is an event in React?
      </div>
      <div id="ansEighteen" class="ans" style="display: none;">In React, events are the triggered reactions to specific
        actions like mouse hover, mouse click, key press, etc. Handling these events are similar to handling events in
        DOM elements. But there are some syntactical differences like:<br>

        1. Events are named using camel case instead of just using the lowercase.<br>
        2. Events are passed as functions instead of strings.<br>
        3. The event argument contains a set of properties, which are specific to an event. Each event type contains its
        own properties and behavior which can be accessed via its event handler only.</div>

      <button onclick="myQuest18()" id="showBtn">Show Answer</button>
    </div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest">What are synthetic events in React?
      </div>
      <div id="ansNineteen" class="ans" style="display: none;">Synthetic events are the objects which act as a
        cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event. They combine the behavior of different browsers into
        one API. This is done to make sure that the events show consistent properties across different browsers.</div>

    </div>

    <div class="questContainer">
      <div class="quest"> What do you understand by refs in React?
      </div>
      <div id="ansTwenty" class="ans" style="display: none;">Refs is the short hand for References in React. It is an
        attribute which helps to store a reference to a particular React element or component, which will be returned by
        the components render configuration function. It is used to return references to a particular element or
        component returned by render(). They come in handy when we need DOM measurements or to add methods to the
        components.
