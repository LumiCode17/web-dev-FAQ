# web-dev-FAQ
As a Junior Web Developer and a job searcher, putting together the little experience i've garthered from both interviewers, junior developers like me i saw that it's not just the language that you know or how you write your codes that actually set you ahead but also the objectives.
I've seeing some junior developers that can match a senior developer of many years when it comes to writing codes, they're very skillful BUT alot of them are only good when it comes to coding but can't explain some questions or give answers to some questions about the languages they know, though they can use it but they don't know or find it difficult in giving answers to questions about coding.

So because of this i created this little web and in it you've several questions and answers to them about several web-Dev tools an languages that are useful for everyday life and especially for interviews.

Be free to add to them if you would.

Thanks
